# matrix-multiplication-
matrix multiplication using thread
In this project, there are 2 implementation of the matrix multiplication algorithm:
Version 1)The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.
Version 2)The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.
Codebase:
this codebase consists of two source files and a Makefile.
a) project.c. This file generates two matrices, and calls the function that multiplies both
matrices. (Make your project, run ./lab6 to see what is happening). 
b) matmult.c. This file contains three functions:
• matmult
• matmult_v1
• matmult_v2
c) Makefile.
